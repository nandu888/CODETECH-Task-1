**Project Name : CREATE A JAVA PROGRAM TO READ, WRITE, AND MODIFY TEXT FILES.**
**Overview of File Handling Utility**

A File Handling Utility is a software tool or library designed to simplify and streamline file operations in a program. It provides a set of functions or methods to perform common file-related tasks such as reading, writing, appending, deleting, and managing files and directories. File handling utilities are essential in programming because they allow developers to interact with the file system efficiently and securely.

These utilities are often built into programming languages (e.g., Java's java.io and java.nio packages) or provided as third-party libraries. They abstract the complexities of low-level file operations, making it easier for developers to work with files.
